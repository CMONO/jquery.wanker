jquery.wanker
=============

Responsive design has been a blessing to web crafters everywhere. The web, however, was meant to be read, not squished. **jquery.wanker.js** is a simple, silly jQuery plugin that reveals a message takeover when people start wanking (excessively resizing) their desktop web browser.

## Usage
`$("#wanker").wanker();`
